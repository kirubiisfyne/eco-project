Brenston The Tourist: Ahoy there, friend! Isn’t the sea just gorgeous today?
- It really is!
Brenston The Tourist: Aye, the breeze, the gulls, the scent of salt in the air—makes a man feel alive, I tell ya!
Brenston The Tourist: But… sigh… what a shame to see all this rubbish floating in the waves. Bottles, bags… it's enough to make the heart weep.
Brenston The Tourist: I came for a joyful swim and instead I’m fishing out plastic more than fish!
Brenston The Tourist: Say, would you help an old tourist clean up this lovely shore?
- Absolutely, Brenston. Let’s do it!
- That's why I am here!
Brenston The Tourist: Hah! That’s the spirit I hoped for. You’ve got salt in your soul, friend!

Brenston the Tourist: Well now—would you look at that! The shore’s never looked finer!
- Glad I could help, Brenston.
- It does look amazing now!
Brenston the Tourist: Aye, it truly warms the heart. The waves are clearer, the breeze is sweeter… even the gulls seem to be singing a happier tune!
Brenston the Tourist: You’ve done more than clean this beach, friend—you’ve restored a bit of magic to the sea.
Brenston the Tourist: From the bottom of this old sailor’s heart, thank you.
- Anytime, Brenston.
- Let’s keep it clean together!
Brenston the Tourist: Aye! With folks like you around, the ocean’s in good hands.
